# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-PROJECT


SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - Sentiment analysis studies the subjective information in an
expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or
entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. For example: “I really like
the new design of your website!” → Positive.

• You are provided with a dataset of the ‘restaurant review’ taken from kaggle. Build a
machine learning model by using Support vector classifier(SVM) and count vectorizer using
two methods(direct method, pipeline method) to predict the label of the review either as positive or negative.

• Also use MultinomialNB (Naïve bayes) and count vectorizer using two methods(direct method, pipeline method) to classifiy if the sentiment is positive or negative and compare the
accuracies of all 4 models of the models

• [[NOTE :There are two features - ‘review’ - the sentence and ‘sentiment’ - the label for the
review. 1 means positive review and 0 means negative review.]]
You are supposed to
1.Create a dataframe

2.process the data and do visualizations (represent using matplotlib / seaborn the number of positive reviews and negative reviews)( ex-use a bar graph ).

3.create svc model and count vectorizer separately (method 1)
